# buffer_I-O
This is the repository for buffered I/O in GoLang.
The bufio package provides a buffered I/O in GoLang.If we send data to a buffer with a limit l then the buffer will take all those data and will not write until it reaches the length l. After which it writes the data and flushes the buffer. And the operation goes this way.
